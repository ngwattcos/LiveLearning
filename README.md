Personal Duplicate of Repository Submitted For School

Live!Learning is a Node.js–based web application that allows anyone to teach their own classes in real-time using a virtual “whiteboard”. Anyone can create or sign up for classes as long as they have an internet connection. This project was envisioned as a "live KhanAcademy".
